#The 1000 Genomes Project Publications

The main publications from the 1000 Genomes Project are the final publications from phase 3 of the project, which were published in *Nature* in October 2015.

- ["A global reference for human genetic variation" *Nature* **526** 68-74 2015](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15393.html)

- ["An integrated map of structural variation in 2,504 human genomes" *Nature* **526** 75-81 2015](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15394.html)

The Consortium also produced publications from the earlier data phases of the project, which were the initial pilot and phase 1 of the main project. No equivalent paper was produced for phase 2, which focused on technical development work.

- ["An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes" *Nature* **491** 56-65 2012](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html)

- ["A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing" *Nature* **467** 1061-1073 2010](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09534.html)
