#Gambian Genome Variation Project

The sequence data in this collection was generated by the Kwiatkowski group at the [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI)](www.sanger.ac.uk/people/direct
ory/kwiatkowski-dominic) and the [Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford](http://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/principal-investigators/researcher/domini
c-kwiatkowski). Please see the [WTSI data sharing policy](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/who-we-are/policies/open-access-science) for details on the use of
 this data, in addition to respecting [Fort Lauderdale principles](https://www.genome.gov/pages/research/wellcomereport0303.pdf) and reading the accompanying [Data Reuse policy](/data_collections/gambian-genome-variation-project/README_gambian_genome_variation_project_datareuse_statement/).

###Gambian Genome Variation Project aims
"The purpose of the project is to support the discovery and understanding of genetic variants that influence human disease. Specifically defined goals are (a) the discovery of single nucleotide variants at frequencies of 1% or higher in diverse populations (b) even more comprehensive discovery (variants down to frequencies of 0.1 - 0.5%) in functional gene regions and (c) discovery of structural variants, such as copy number variants, other insertions and deletions, and inversions, including sequence-level understanding of breakpoints."

###Data description
The sequence data is 4x coverage of individuals from four Gambian populations.

The data is from the following European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) study IDs:
* ERP001420 - Fula
* ERP001781 - Jola
* ERP002150 - Woloff
* ERP002385 - Mandinka
