## About

The variation data discovered by the 1000 genomes project are organised in VCF files. The Variation Pattern Finder allows one to look for patterns of shared variation between individuals in the same vcf file. To be more specific, in any user-specified chromosomal regions, different samples would have different combination of variations. The finder looks for distinct variation combinations within the region, as well as individuals associated with each variation combination pattern. The finder only focuses on variations that change protein coding sequences such as non-synonymous coding SNPs, splice site changes.

## Input

You can access the online version of the [variation pattern finder tool](http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VariationPattern?db=core) from the tools link in the menu bar at the top of every page in the [Ensembl GRCh37 browser](http://grch37.ensembl.org/).

The input interface of the online version looks like:

![VPF input field](variation_pattern_finder_input.png "VPF input")

The tool allows you to pick which phase of the 1000 Genomes Project you want to get data from. If you have a publicly visible VCF file, corresponding tabix index (.tbi) and a corresponding sample-population mapping file in the same folder, you could get data from these by selecting "Provide file URLs".

The pattern finder must be given a genomic interval to search within. This works best with regions of less than 500bp as the number of variation patterns is more manageable.

## Output Format

The file is tab separated. The first line begins with `freq` then lists all the variants found within the region in the form `chromosome:coordinate_rsID[variant allele]`, each in their own column, then ends with `samples`. The second line also starts and ends with `freq` and `samples`, and under each variant column lists the transcript(s) hit by each variant and the consequence on that transcript, separated by columns.

The following lines give the variant patterns. The first `freq` column gives the frequency of each pattern, the variant columns list the phased genotype for those particular variants in the pattern, and the final `samples` column lists the populations where individuals are found with those patterns, the number of individuals and the identifiers of the first three individuals.

## Using the Variation Pattern Finder with other data

The Variation Pattern Finder will work with any publicly visible remove (over http or ftp) vcf file which also has a tabix index. For more information about creating tabix indexes please look at [Tabix: fast retrieval of sequence features from generic TAB-delimited files](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/5/718.short?rss=1) for more information about creating these indexes.

## Additional Info

In addition to use the Finder to mine the VCF file, you may look into a VCF file directly. Rather than download the entire VCF file for the whole genome, you may slice out the piece of VCF file that contains data in a user-specified chromosomal region using another tool called [Data Slicer](http://www.internationalgenome.org/data-slicer/). Data Slicer can also slice BAM files.

## API Script

You can also find a perl script version of this tool [on the Ensembl GRCh37 tools page](http://grch37.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/index.html).
