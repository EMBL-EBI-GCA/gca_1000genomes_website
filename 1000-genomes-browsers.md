#Genome Browsers

##1000 Genomes data in Ensembl

Following completion of the 1000 Genomes Project, we recommend using Ensembl to view the data, in preference to the early access browsers created during the 1000 Genomes Project. Ensembl provides a genome browser where the data can be viewed alongside a wide range of additional data sources, as well as giving access to [tools](http://grch37.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/index.html) that can be used to work with the 1000 Genomes data and other data sets.

In Ensembl, the data can be viewed either on the GRCh37 reference assembly (used by the final, phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project) or on the current reference genome, GRCh38.

- **[Ensembl GRCh37](http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index) - view the 1000 Genomes Project data on the reference genome used by the project**
- **[Ensembl GRCh38](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index) - view the 1000 Genomes Project data on the current human reference genome**

##1000 Genomes Project early access browsers

During the lifetime of the 1000 Genomes Project, data was shared as soon as possible via early access browsers for each of the data production phases of the project. This enabled the data to be viewed on the genome prior to variant calls being processed and archived in the variation databases, such as dbSNP. Currently, the early access browsers remain available.

- [1000 Genomes Project phase 3 browser](http://phase3browser.1000genomes.org/index.html) - SNPs and indels from the [phase 3 release](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/). This browser runs Ensembl version 80.
- [1000 Genomes Project phase 1 browser](http://phase1browser.1000genomes.org/index.html) - data from phase 1. This browser runs Ensembl version 73.
- [1000 Genomes Project pilot browser](http://pilotbrowser.1000genomes.org/index.html) - data from the pilot phase. This browser uses Ensembl version 60 and is based on reference genome NCBI36.

###Tutorials and guides

You can find instructions for how to use the 1000 Genomes Project browsers [in .doc format](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/browser/1000genomes_browser_main_project_20110521/The_1000_Genomes_Browser_Tutorial.ensembl_65.doc). There is also a [tutorial](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/1000_genomes_browser_pilot_20110506.doc) for the pilot browser and a [Quickstart Guide](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/1000genomes_browser_quickstart.pdf).

You can also access the databases which sit behind the browser, for more details about this please look at [the Public MySQL Instance](/node/517) page.

There are also more tips for Ensembl both on the [main Ensembl site](http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/index.html) and their [blog](http://www.ensembl.info/).

The [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) also provide a [1000 genomes browser](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/tools/1000genomes/) hosted on their site.
