The Gambian Genome Variation Project is a collaboration of the [MRC Unit in The Gambia](http://www.mrc.gm), the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk), the [MRC Centre for Genomics and Global Health](https://www.cggh.org/collaborations/mrc-unit-the-gambia) at Oxford University, and the [MalariaGEN Resource Centre](https://www.malariagen.net). The purpose of the project was to support the discovery and understanding of genetic variants that influence human disease. Specifically defined goals were:

 * the discovery of single nucleotide variants at frequencies of 1% or higher in diverse populations
 * even more comprehensive discovery (variants down to frequencies of 0.1 - 0.5%) in functional gene regions, and
 * discovery of structural variants, such as copy number variants, other insertions and deletions, and inversions, including sequence-level understanding of breakpoints.

###Data description
The sequence data is 9x coverage of individuals from four Gambian populations.

The data is from the following European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) study IDs:

* ERP001420 - Fula

* ERP001781 - Jola

* ERP002150 - Woloff

* ERP002385 - Mandinka

This data was originally analysed on GRCh37. That work is described in the [Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13480-z) publication.
