The New York Genome Center (NYGC), funded by NHGRI, has resequenced the 2504 sample phase three panel from the 1000 Genomes Project to 30x coverage. NYGC aligned the data to GRCh38() and those alignments are available. The alignments hosted in ENA and included in our data portal and URLs are also listed on our FTP site (see below). Alternatively, the alignments can be accessed via AnVIL(), AWS() and the NCBI FTP site().

An initial GATK HaplotypeCaller call set from NYGC is available on our FTP site. Analysis of this data is ongoing and further call sets are expected.
