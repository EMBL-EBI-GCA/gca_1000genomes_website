The [New York Genome Center (NYGC)](https://www.nygenome.org), funded by [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov), has resequenced the 2504 sample phase three panel from the 1000 Genomes Project to 30x coverage. NYGC [aligned the data to GRCh38](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/20190405_NYGC_b38_pipeline_description.pdf) and those alignments are publicly available. The alignments are hosted in [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB31736). Details, including URLs, are in our data portal and are also listed on our [FTP site](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/1000G_2504_high_coverage.sequence.index). Alternatively, the alignments can be accessed at the collowing locations:

* AnVIL - https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/1000G-high-coverage-2019Â  
* AWS - s3://1000genomes/1000G_2504_high_coverage/
* NCBI FTP - ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/1000G_2504_high_coverage/

An [initial GATK HaplotypeCaller call set from NYGC](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20190425_NYGC_GATK/) is available on our FTP site. Analysis of this data is ongoing and further call sets are expected.
