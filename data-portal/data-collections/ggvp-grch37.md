The Gambian Genome Variation Project is a collaboration of the [MRC Unit in The Gambia](http://www.mrc.gm), the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk), the [MRC Centre for
Genomics and Global Health](https://www.cggh.org/collaborations/mrc-unit-the-gambia) at Oxford
University, and the [MalariaGEN Resource Centre](https://www.malariagen.net). The purpose of the
project was to support the discovery and understanding of genetic variants that influence human
disease. Specifically defined goals were:

  * the discovery of single nucleotide variants at frequencies of 1% or higher in diverse populations,
  * even more comprehensive discovery (variants down to frequencies of 0.1 - 0.5%) in functional gene regions, and
  * discovery of structural variants, such as copy number variants, other insertions and deletions, and inversions, including sequence-level understanding of breakpoints.

This data also forms part of the data set described in this [bioRxiv publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/535898).
