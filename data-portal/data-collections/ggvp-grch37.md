The Gambian Genome Variation Project is a collaboration of the MRC Unit in The Gambia
(<http://www.mrc.gm>), the Wellcome Sanger Institute (<https://www.sanger.ac.uk>), the MRC Centre for
Genomics and Global Health (<https://www.cggh.org/collaborations/mrc-unit-the-gambia>) at Oxford
University, and the MalariaGEN Resource Centre (<https://www.malariagen.net>). The purpose of the
project was to support the discovery and understanding of genetic variants that influence human
disease. Specifically defined goals were:

  a. the discovery of single nucleotide variants at frequencies of 1% or higher in diverse populations,
  b. even more comprehensive discovery (variants down to frequencies of 0.1 - 0.5%) in functional gene regions, and
  c. discovery of structural variants, such as copy number variants, other insertions and deletions, and inversions, including sequence-level understanding of breakpoints.

## Included samples

Samples were ascertained in family trios (father/mother/child). The following table reflects sample
counts following a process of resolution of family relationships described below:

Population | Acronym | # sequenced individuals | # trios | # duos | # unrelateds | ENA project accession | ENA study accession
