The data in this collection represents the final work of the 1000 Genomes Project, as completed in phase three of the project on GRCh37.

This work is described in [The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15393.html), with work on structural variation described in [Sudmant et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15394).

Some key files include:

* The [GRCh37 reference genome](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/) used in this analysis
* Files listing the [samples](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/) used in the work (.ped and panel)
* [VCF files](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/) containing the variants detected and additional genotype VCF files listing genetypes for each individual at each variant location (provided per chromosome due to file size)

Considerable additional information can be found in the supplementary material of the publications mentioned above.
