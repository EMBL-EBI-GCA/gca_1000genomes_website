The data in this collection is described in [Mallick et al. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18964). The samples in the Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) overlap with samples in the 1000 Genomes Project and the collection of samples held at CEPH for the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP). Sequence data from additional HGDP samples can be found in the HGDP data presented by [Bergstr√∂m et al.](/data-portal/data-collection/hgdp).
