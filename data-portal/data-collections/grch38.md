This collection presents a reanalysis of the sequence data generated by the original 1000 Genomes Project.

The 1000 Genomes Project used primarily a combination of exome and low-coverage sequence data to analyse a panel of 2,504 unrelated individuals in phase three of that project on the GRCh37 reference assembly. That data and analysis is available in our [phase three data collection](/data-portal/data-collection/phase-3).

This collection realigns and recalls the sequence data from the original project on the GRCh38 assembly. A description of the alignments is given in [Zheng-Bradley et al. (2017)](https://test.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample) and the variant calling is described in [Lowy-Gallego et al. (2019)](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-50).
