title: "Short Tandem Repeats added to the 1000 Genomes Release #ASHG14"
---
                    
<p>We have added two sets of STR predictions and genotypes to the 1000 Genomes dataset.</p>
<p>These are available in the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/">supporting</a> directory <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/strs/">strs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The call set were created using <a href="http://melissagymrek.com/lobstr-code/">LobSTR</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/adaptivegenome/repeatseq">RepeatSeq</a>&nbsp;respectively.</p>
<p>The sites are genotyped in all 2535 individuals who were used in our final release. This includes the 31 individuals who are related to other individuals in the main call set.&nbsp;</p>
