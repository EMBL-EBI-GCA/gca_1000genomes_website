title: "Chromosome X variants added to the final release #ASHG14"
---
                    
We have now added a set of Chromosome X variants as part of our final release.

The genotypes and sites are available in [our main release directory](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/).

We will update the file during November. We need to add functional annotation and super population allele frequency and per site sequence depth information.
