The Phase 3 publication, [A global reference for human genetic variation](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15393.html) and the Phase 3 Structural variation publication, [An integrated map of structural variation in 2,504 human genomes](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15394.html) are now available from [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html) alongside a [celebration of 25 years of the Human Genome Project](http://www.nature.com/collections/dcfqmlgsrw)

The variants from the Phase 3 analysis are available in [ftp/release/20130502/](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/) and extended information about the SV dataset can be found in [ftp/phase3/integrated_sv_map/](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/integrated_sv_map/).

Both these papers are open access and should be free for everyone to read and download.
