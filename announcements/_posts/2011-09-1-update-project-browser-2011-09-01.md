title: "Update to Project Browser"

The project browser based on the [20100804](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20100804/) variant release and has been moved to the latest version of [Ensembl, 63](http://www.ensembl.org/).

The new browser features a new [Variation Pattern Finder]({{site.browser_url}}/Homo_sapiens/UserData/VariationsMapVCF) and improvements to the [Data Slicer ]({{site.browser_url}}/Homo_sapiens/UserData/SelectSlice?db=core) to allow vcf slices to be subselected on the basis of individual or if associations provided by population. All location based pages also now have a get vcf button which transfers you to the Data slicer with the coordinates fill out and the path of the vcf for our 20100804 release filled in. For more information about the new features which are part of the Ensembl project please look at their [blog post](http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2011/06/30/ensembl-63-is-out/) on the matter
