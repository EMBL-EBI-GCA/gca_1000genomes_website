title: "Integrative Annotation of Variants from 1092 Humans: Application to Cancer Genomics"
---
                    
The Functional Analysis group from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium have published its findings based on the Phase 1 integrated analysis in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/1235587.abstract?rss=1) today. 

The functional annotation itself is available from the [phase1 analysis results directory](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/functional_annotation/) on our FTP site.

We also provide the supplementary information associated with the paper in the [phase1 paper directory](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/paper/integrative_annotation/)
