<p>The Functional Analysis group from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium have published its findings based on the Phase 1 integrated analysis in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/1235587.abstract?rss=1">Science</a> today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The functional annotation itself is available from the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/functional_annotation/">phase1 analysis results directory</a> on our FTP site.</p>
<p>We also provide the supplementary information associated with the paper in the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/paper/integrative_annotation/">phase1 paper directory</a></p>
