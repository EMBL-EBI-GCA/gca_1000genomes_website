<p style="text-align: justified;">The new browser features a new <a href="http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/UserData/VariationsMapVCF" target="_blank">Variation Pattern Finder</a> and improvements to the <a href="http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/UserData/SelectSlice?db=core" target="_blank">Data Slicer&nbsp;</a> to allow vcf slices to be subselected on the basis of individual or if associations provided by population. All location based pages also now have a get vcf button which transfers you to the Data slicer with the coordinates fill out and the path of the vcf for our 20100804 release filled in.
