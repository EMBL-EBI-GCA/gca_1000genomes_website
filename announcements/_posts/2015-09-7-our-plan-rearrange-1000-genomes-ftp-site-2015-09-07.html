title: "Our plan to rearrange the 1000 Genomes FTP site?"
---
                    
<p>Starting from the 14th September, we plan to rearrange the 1000 Genomes FTP site to reflect our on going efforts to provide support for the data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project and other data created on the 1000 Genomes cell lines.</p>
<p>This restructure involved creating a data_collections directory which will hold directories for each project or dataset. We plan to remove the headline ftp/data directory and move specific datasets into those data collection directories.</p>
<p>We are also improving our top level FTP READMEs and index files and the old files will be moved into a historical_data directory.</p>
<p>You can get an overview of the planned changes from this <a href="/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/ftp_site_proposed_changes_20150901.pdf">attached pdf</a></p>
<p>We will produce full changelogs which reflect these file moves and no files will be deleted.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our plans please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@1000genomes.org">info@1000genomes.org</a></p>
