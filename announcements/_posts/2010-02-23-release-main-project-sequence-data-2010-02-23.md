title: "Release of main project sequence data"

An updated set of sequence data now available on the ftp site. We have also updated the readme to reflect a new column being added to the sequence.index file and the additional statistics file which is now associated with the index.

The population column of the sequence index has also been rationalised to use only the three letter population codes. Definitions of each code can be found in the readme file below.
