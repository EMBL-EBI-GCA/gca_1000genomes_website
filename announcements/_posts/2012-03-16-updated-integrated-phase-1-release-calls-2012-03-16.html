<p>This <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521">March 2012</a> release represents a improved set of our integrated phase 1 variant release. This release represents version 3 of an integrated variant call set based on both low coverage and exome whole genome sequence data. This is an updated set from the version 2 (February 2012) of the 20110521 release. For this release approximately 2.38M indels have been filtered from the version 2 call set. See <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/README.indel_filtering_20120316">README_v3&nbsp;</a> for more information.</p>
