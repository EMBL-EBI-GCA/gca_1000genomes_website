 <p>The alignments based on the&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20110521.sequence.index"><span>20110521.sequence.index</span></a>&nbsp;have been updated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><span>Illumina</span>&nbsp;data was aligned at Boston College and&nbsp;<span>SOLiD</span>&nbsp;data at Baylor College of Medicine. Full project data is aligned to the&nbsp;<span>GRCh37</span>&nbsp;human assembly. In the updated release, all Baylor SOLiD BAMs and associated bai and bas files have been replaced; the new BAMs are now re-calibrated and locally re-aligned.</p>
