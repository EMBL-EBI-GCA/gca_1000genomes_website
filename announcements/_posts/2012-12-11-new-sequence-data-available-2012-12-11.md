Additional sequence data from the 1000 Genomes full project are now available. The current sequence.index file can be found at:

[20121211.sequence.index](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20121211.sequence.index)

Going forward the project plans to produce alignments and variant calls using only Illumina platform sequence data with 70bp reads or longer. This data set has been put into the [analysis.sequence.index](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20121211.analysis.sequence.index). There is more info about this in our [FAQ](/faq/what-difference-between-sequenceindex-and-analysissequenceindex)
