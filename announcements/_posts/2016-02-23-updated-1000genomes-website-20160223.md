We have released a major update to the 1000 Genomes Website. The 1000 Genomes Project data is now maintained by the International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR). IGSR aims to support and extend the 1000 Genomes Project data. You can read more about IGSR on our [about page](http://www.1000genomes.org/about).

We are in the process of updating all the context to reflect the ongoing efforts with the project data. If you find any issues or can't find an old page, please email [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org)
