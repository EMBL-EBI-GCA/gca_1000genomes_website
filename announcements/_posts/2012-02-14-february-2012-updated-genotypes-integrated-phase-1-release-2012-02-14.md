This [February 2012](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20120316_phase1_integrated_release_version2) release represents a new improved set of phased genotypes for our integrated phase 1 variant release. This release contains SNPS, short INDELs and Deletions based on low coverage and exome sequencing data across 1092 individuals.

Please note the sites list has been filtered to remove a small number of indels which were discovered to have a high false positve rate. There is more information about this in the [README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/README.phase1_integrated_release_version2_20120214)

Our [FAQ](faq) contains instructions on how to get [smaller subsections](/faq/how-do-i-get-sub-section-vcf-file) of these files
