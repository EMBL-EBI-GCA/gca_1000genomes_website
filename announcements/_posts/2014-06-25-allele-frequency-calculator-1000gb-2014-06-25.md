We have created a new tool to calculate population specific allele frequencies. The [Allele Frequency Calculator]({{site.browser_url}}/Homo_sapiens/UserData/Allele) will calculate and provide a table of population specific allele frequencies from a vcf file and sample panel file.

The tool is [documented on this website](/allele-frequency-calculator-documentation)

The tool currently has two run modes, the first gives you the allele frequencies for a particular population. The second is run by selecting the ALL population and this gives you the allele frequency for all the populations as well as the global allele frequency.

Please do note in genomic regions which are very variant dense or very large regions the tool will run more slowly.

Please send any questions about the tool to [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org)
