The project browser has been updated to include [20100804](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20100804/) variant release and has been moved to the latest version of [Ensembl, 62](http://www.ensembl.org).

A tutorial for the updated browser is available [here](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/1000_genomes_browser_62_tutorial_20110506.doc).

New features include a [Data Slicer](http://browser.1000genomes.org/tools.html) tool which provides the ability to get subsections of vcf and bam files. Transcript consequences also now include Sift and Polyphen scores for [non synonymous SNPs.](http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Mappings?db=core;r=6:73933774-73935285;source=dbSNP;v=rs112860401;vdb=variation;vf=15765239)

The pilot browser is still available at [http://pilotbrowser.1000genomes.org](http://pilotbrowser.1000genomes.org)
