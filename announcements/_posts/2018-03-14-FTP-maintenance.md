Our FTP site will be undergoing maintenance on Thursday 22nd March. This work is due to take place between 10.30am and 2.30pm GMT. During this time, we expect read access to be interrupted, which may disrupt large downloads. The service is expected to return to normal after this period. 

If you have any questions regarding this work, please contact us at [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org).
