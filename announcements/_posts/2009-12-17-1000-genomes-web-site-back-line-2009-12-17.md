The 1000 Genomes web site at 1000genomes.org is now available again.

As part of the recovery of the site, we had to change all of the passwords for those of you that have wiki accounts. You can request your password by selecting the "Send me my password" link on the left side of the page. You will then receive an automated email with a new password and instructions for activating that password. You may have to check your junk mail box to find this email.
