Two Accessibility Tracks have now been added to the [1000 Genomes Browser ]({{site.browser_url}}/index.html)

This information was built using sequence data from the [phase1 dataset](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/)

The two tracks are called the 1000 Genomes Pilot Accessibility Mask and the 1000 Genomes Strict Accessibility Mask.

There is a [README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/accessible_genome_masks/README_20120824_accessibility_mask_bed_files) which describes how this data set was created. The raw bed and fasta files are also available in the [accessible genome ftp directory](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/accessible_genome_masks/)
