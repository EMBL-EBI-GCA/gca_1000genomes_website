The alignments based on the [ 20110521.sequence.index ](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20110521.sequence.index) have been updated. 

Illumina data was aligned at Boston College and SOLiD data at Baylor College of Medicine. Full project data is aligned to the GRCh37 human assembly. In the updated release, all Baylor SOLiD BAMs and associated bai and bas files have been replaced; the new BAMs are now re-calibrated and locally re-aligned.
