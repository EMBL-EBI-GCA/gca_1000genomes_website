title: "BAM Statistics files added to FTP site?"
---
                    
<p>719 new .bas (bam statistics) files have been added to the FTP site and 1129 .bas files have been replaced. The relpaced files have corrected bam file names and statistics including #_total_bases and %_of_mismatched_bases. The alignment index files will be updated shortly to give #_total_bases and #_mapped_bases for each bam file entry.</p>
