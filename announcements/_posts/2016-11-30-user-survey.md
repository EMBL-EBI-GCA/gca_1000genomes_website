We are conducting a user survey, to help us improve the accessibility of the 1000 Genomes data. The survey takes around five minutes to complete and we would welcome your participation, which will help guide the development of this resource.

Update: As of 6th January, our [survey has closed](/announcements/IGSR-user-survey/). However, feedback is welcome at [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org).
