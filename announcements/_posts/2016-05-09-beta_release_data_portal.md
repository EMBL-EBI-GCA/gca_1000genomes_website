We have built a new tool to allow users to explore all the data from the 1000 Genomes Project and other groups hosted through our website and ftp site.

You can access this new tool using the [URL http://www.1000genomes.org/data-portal](http://www.1000genomes.org/data-portal)

This is represents a beta release of the portal. We are working to improve it and will add new features over the coming months.

Please email us at [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org) to let us know if you like the portal, if anything doesn't work as expected or if you have any other feedback.
