The IGSR helpdesk at info@1000genomes.org will be closed temporarily from 9am GMT on Friday 25th November until 9am GMT on Monday 28th November. This is to enable migration of the system to new infrastructure. During this time, any messages sent will be held in a queue. You will not receive any confirmation of your email, as this is automatically generated by the system. If we have not responded to you by 5th December, please contact us again. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.
