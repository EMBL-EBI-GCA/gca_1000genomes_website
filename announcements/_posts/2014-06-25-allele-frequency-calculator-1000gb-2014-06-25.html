title: "The Allele Frequency Calculator #1000GB?"
---
                    
<p>We have created a new tool to calculate population specific allele frequencies. The <a href="http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/UserData/Allele">Allele Frequency Calculator</a> will calculate and provide a table of population specific allele frequencies from a vcf file and sample panel file.</p>
<p>The tool is <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/allele-frequency-calculator-documentation">documented on this website</a></p>
<p>The tool currently has two run modes, the first gives you the allele frequencies for a particular population. The second is run by selecting the ALL population and this gives you the allele frequency for all the populations as well as the global allele frequency.</p>
<p>Please do note in genomic regions which are very variant dense or very large regions the tool will run more slowly.</p>
<p>Please send any questions about the tool to <a href="mailto:info@1000genomes.org">info@1000genomes.org</a></p>
