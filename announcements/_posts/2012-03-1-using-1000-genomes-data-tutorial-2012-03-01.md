title: "Using 1000 Genomes Data, A tutorial"
---
                    
We have created a [tutorial](http://www.1000genomes.org/using-1000-genomes-data) to give users a basic background into the 1000genomes project.

This includes a series of slides covering the background and history of the project, the structure and format of the raw data, our browser and our tools.

There are exercises for both our browser and web based tools and command line tools which are useful when working with 1000 genomes data.

All the tutorial documents can be found on our [ftp site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20120229_tutorial_docs/).
