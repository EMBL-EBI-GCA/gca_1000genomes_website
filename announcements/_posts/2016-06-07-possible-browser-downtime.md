Due to necessary maintenance work, there is a possibility that our genome browser may be unavailable for a short period between 10am and 11am British Summer Time on Wednesday 7th June. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Data from 1000 Genomes will, however, still be accessible via [Ensembl](http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html).
