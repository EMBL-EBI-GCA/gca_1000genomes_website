title: "GRCh38 mapping of the 1000 Genomes low coverage data is now available?"
---
                    
<p>We have realigned the low coverage 1000 Genomes sequence data to GRCh38. We aligned to the full assembly including the GRC maintained alternate loci sequences and decoy and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/">additional HLA sequences from the IMGT</a>, our fasta file can be found in <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/GRCh38_reference_genome/">our reference directory</a>. The alignment was carried out using a new alt-aware version of <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa/tree/master/bwakit">BWA-mem</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alignment files themselves can be found in the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/data">data_collections/1000_genomes_project/data</a> directory.</p>

<p>Please note, these files are now being distributed in CRAM format, rather than BAM format. You can find more details about CRAM in this <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README_using_1000genomes_cram.md">README</a></p>
