<p>This <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20120316_phase1_integrated_release_version2">February 2012</a> release represents a new improved set of phased genotypes for our integrated phase 1 variant release. This release contains SNPS, short INDELs and Deletions based on low coverage and exome sequencing data across 1092 individuals.</p>
<p>Please note the sites list has been filtered to remove a small number of indels which were discovered to have a high false positve rate. There is more information about this in the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/README.phase1_integrated_release_version2_20120214">README</a></p>
