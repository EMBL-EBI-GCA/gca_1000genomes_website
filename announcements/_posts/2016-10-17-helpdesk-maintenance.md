Due to essential maintenance, the 1000 Genomes helpdesk email will be shut down for approximately 48 hours, 
beginning at 9 am (BST) on 24th October. Any emails sent during this time will be held in a queue, and we will 

respond to them when the system is up and running again, although there may be some delay. You will not receive 
any confirmation of your email, as this is automatically generated by the system.

We will update you when the system is back.

We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.
