The alignments based on the [20100517.sequence.index](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20100517.sequence.index) have been released. BAM files with more data replace older (and now withdrawn) BAM files with less data. Illumina data was aligned at the Sanger Institute and SOLiD data at TGEN. More information is available in from the links below. Main project data is aligned to the GRCh37 human assembly.
