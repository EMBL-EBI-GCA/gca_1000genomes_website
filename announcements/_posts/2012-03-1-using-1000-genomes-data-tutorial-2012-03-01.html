title: "Using 1000 Genomes Data, A tutorial"
---
                    
<p>We have created a <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/using-1000-genomes-data">tutorial</a> to give users a basic background into the 1000genomes project.</p>
<p>This includes a series of slides covering the background and history of the project, the structure and format of the raw data, our browser and our tools.</p>
<p>There are exercises for both our browser and web based tools and command line tools which are useful when working with 1000 genomes data.</p>
<p>All the tutorial documents can be found on our <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20120229_tutorial_docs/" target="_blank">ftp site</a>.</p>
