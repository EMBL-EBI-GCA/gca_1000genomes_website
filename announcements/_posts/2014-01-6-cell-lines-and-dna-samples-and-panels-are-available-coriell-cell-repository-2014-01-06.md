All the samples from the 1000 genomes are available as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and LCL derived DNA from the [Coriell Cell Repository](http://ccr.coriell.org/) as part of the [NHGRI Catalog](http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/NHGRI/?SsId=11). In addition Standard Population DNA Panels for the 1000 Genomes and HapMap projects are available at $1000 or less each.

A full listing of all the populations available can be see on the [Coriell Cell lines and DNA page](http://www.1000genomes.org/cell-lines-and-dna-coriell).
