1000 Genomes Project and Beyond   

24-26 June 2014   

Churchill College, Cambridge, UK   

This Wellcome Trust conference will focus on advances enabled by the 1000 Genomes Project, including the new directions in genetics and genomics that it has facilitated. It is the latest in the successful series of community meetings for the HapMap and 1000 Genomes Project, marking the end of the 1000 Genomes Project this summer.   

Scientific sessions will include:   

* Patterns of genetic variation within and between populations   
* Management and processing of whole genome sequence data   
* Whole genome sequencing in complex and rare diseases   
* Human evolution   
* Functional analysis of variation   
* Genome sequencing: the past, present and future
