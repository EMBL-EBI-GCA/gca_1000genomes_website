title: "Changes to the 1000 Genomes Globus endpoint"

EMBL-EBI has recently rearranged its Globus hosted endpoints.

This means the Globus endpoint for 1000G data is changing from ebi#1000g to ebi#public ('1000g' subfolder). The old endpoint will be discontinued shortly. The new endpoint is configured to achieve increased reliability and performance. If you have any questions about the change please contact [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org).
