Our Aspera service is being updated. As part of this work, the service is being moved to new hardware and the configuration is being updated. 

The service can be used as before but command line users should add the port specification -P33001 to their command. In addition, users whose firewalls block such connections by default will need open ports to the EBI IP address 193.62.193.135. More information on working with Aspera is available in our description of [using Aspera to download data](/faq/how-download-files-using-aspera).

The upgrade will come into effect from the end of July 2017. The above changes are compatible with the existing service, so we encourage users to adopt any necessary changes now. Prior to the upgraded service coming into use at the end of the month, it is available for testing at fasp-beta.ebi.ac.uk.

Should you have any queries about these changes, please contact us at [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org).
