To enable future expansion of [EMBL-EBIâ€™s](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) resources and services, one of the data centres supporting our services will be moving to a new location in the period 16-20th March. The data hosted by IGSR will remain available throughout this time. Data can be accessed via [Globus](https://www.internationalgenome.org/faq/can-i-access-1000-genomes-data-globus-online) and FTP. The usual FTP URL [ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/) may experience some downtime but the data can also be accessed via FTP at [ftp.ebi.ac.uk/1000g](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/1000g). Our Aspera download service is expected to experience downtime during this period and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. Should you have any questions please contact us at info@1000genomes.org.
