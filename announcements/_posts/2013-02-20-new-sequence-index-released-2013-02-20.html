title: "New sequence index released?"
---
                    
<p>In order to meet phase3 release timelines, we are going to make more frequent sequence index releases. Basically we are checking data submission weekly; a new sequence index will be released when 25 or more new samples or 250GB or more new sequences are detected. &nbsp;This way BAM files can be created incrementally without much delay.</p>
