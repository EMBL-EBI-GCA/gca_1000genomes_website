title: "Chromosome X variants added to the final release #ASHG14"
---
                    
<p>We have now added a set of Chromosome X variants as part of our final release.</p>
<p>The genotypes and sites are available in <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/">our main release directory</a>.</p>
<p>We will update the file during November. We need to add functional annotation and super population allele frequency and per site sequence depth information.&nbsp;</p>
