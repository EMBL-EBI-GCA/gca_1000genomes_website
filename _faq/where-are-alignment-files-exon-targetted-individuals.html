<p>The alignment files which were used as part of the pilot project are found under&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/data">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/data</a>. These are all aligned to NCBI36.</p>
<p>There are also GRCh37 alignments available for both the high coverage individuals (<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/pilot2_high_cov_GRCh37_bams/">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/pilot2_high_cov_GRCh37_bams/</a>) and the exon targetted individuals (<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/pilot3_exon_targetted_GRCh37_bams/">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/pilot3_exon_targetted_GRCh37_bams/</a>)</p>
<p>Please be aware much of the sequence data these alignments are based on is very short read data (36bp) and was generated a long time ago (~2008) so may not reflect current sequencing data.</p>
