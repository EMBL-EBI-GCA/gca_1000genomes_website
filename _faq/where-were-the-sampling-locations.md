The exact sampling locations are not available. Individuals were sampled based on criteria relating to their ethnicities, with some population groups covering large areas and some very small.

For 1000 Genomes populations, the ethnicity criteria are listed with the populations on the [Coriell website](https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Collections). For other data collections, please check the [associated publications](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection).
