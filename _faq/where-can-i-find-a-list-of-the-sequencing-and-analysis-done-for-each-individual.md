Our data portal has a page for each sample. At the bottom of the page, the various data collections that the sample is present in are listed in tabs. Each tab then lists the available files for that sample, including seqeunce data, genotype arrays, alignments and VCFs.

An example is the page for [NA12878](/data-portal/sample/NA12878). Sample IDs can be entered in the search box to locate a given sample.

To understand the data available for larger groups of samples, the [samples](/data-portal/sample) and [population](/data-portal/population) tabs of the portal can be used to explore available data.
