The project aims to sequence 2500 individuals in total both low coverage whole genome sequencing and exome sequencing. So far more than 1000 samples have been sequenced.

Our completion criteria for our two sequencing stratergies are:

All low coverage samples must have 3x non duplicated aligned coverage (assuming genome size of 2.75GB)  
All exome samples must have 70% of their targets covered to at least 20x. The target list can be found in [technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets_phases1_and_2](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets_phases1_and_2/)
