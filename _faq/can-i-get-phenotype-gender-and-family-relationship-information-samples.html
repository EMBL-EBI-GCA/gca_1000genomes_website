<p>Due to the freely available nature of the 1000genomes data no phenotype information was collected for any of the samples and all donors where over 18 and healthy at the time of collection. We do provide both a <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_sample_info.xlsx">sample spreadsheet</a> and a <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_g1k.ped">pedigree file</a> which contain ethnicity and gender.</p>
