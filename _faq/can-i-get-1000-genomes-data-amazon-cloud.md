At the end of the 1000 Geneoms Project, a large volume of the 1000 Genomes data (the majority of the FTP site) was available on the Amazon AWS cloud as a [public data set](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/4383).

At the end of the 1000 Genomes Project, the [IGSR](/about) was established and the [FTP site has been further developed](/announcements/our-plan-rearrange-1000-genomes-ftp-site-2015-09-07/) since the conclusion of the 1000 Genomes Project, adding additional data sets. The Amazon AWS cloud reflects the data as it was at the end of the 1000 Genomes Project and does not include any updates or new data.

You can find more information about how to use the data in the Amazon AWS cloud on our [AWS help page](/using-1000-genomes-data-amazon-web-service-cloud).
