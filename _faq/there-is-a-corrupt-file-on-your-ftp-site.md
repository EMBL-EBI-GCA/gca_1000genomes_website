As many of our files are very large >5GB they can become corrupt during download.

Before emailing us to let us know about a problem file the first thing you need to check is the md5 checksum of your file to see if it matches our records in the [current.tree](/data#DataAccess) file.

If the size and or the md5 checksum don't match then you need to attempt to download the file again.

If the size of the file and the md5 check sum matches what is in the current.tree then please email [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org) to let us know which file has a problem.
