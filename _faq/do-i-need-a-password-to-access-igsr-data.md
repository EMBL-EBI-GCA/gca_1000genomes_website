All the 1000 genomes information is freely available without passwords.

There are two main sources for our raw and analysis data our ftp site which has two mirrored locations: [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/) and [NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/).  These are accessible using both ftp and a udp protocol called ascp which is available freely from [aspera](http://asperasoft.com/software/transfer-clients/connect-web-browser-plug-in/).  More information about these can be found on the [data access](/data#DataAccess) page.
