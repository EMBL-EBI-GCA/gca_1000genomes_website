The project has two releases of structural variation. [The pilot paper data directory](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/paper_data_sets/a_map_of_human_variation/){:target="_blank"} contains vcf files for deletions, mobile element insertions, tandem duplications and novel sequence both for the low coverage and trio pilot studies. Our [phase1 release integrated release](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets/) contains deletions together with the SNPs and short indels.
