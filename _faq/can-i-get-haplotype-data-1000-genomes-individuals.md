The final data set produced by the 1000 Genomes Project was the [phase 3 integrated data set](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/). This contains fully phased haplotypes for 2,504 individuals and has SNPs, indels and larger deletions. Full details can be found in the [1000 Genomes project phase 3 publication](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15393.html).
