NA12878 the CEU child from our high coverage trio represents our largest amount of sequence data with 4.2 Tbases of sequence, the majority of this sequence data is from 2008 and short read length (~36bp) so is not the highest quality we have. You can see how many bases we have sequenced for all our samples by looking in our [sequence index](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README.sequence_data) file. The 25th column of this file is the base count in each fastq file.
