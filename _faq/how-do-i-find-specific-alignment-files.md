The easiest way to find the alignment files you're looking for is with the [Data Portal](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample). You can search for individuals, populations and data collections, and filter the files by data type and technologies. This will give you locations of the files, which you can use to download directly, or to export a list to use with a download manager.

You can find an index of our alignments in our [alignment.index file](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment.index). There are dated versions of these files and statistics surrounding each alignment release in the [alignment_indicies](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices/) directory. Please note with few exceptions we only keep the most recent QC passed alignment for each sample on the ftp site.
