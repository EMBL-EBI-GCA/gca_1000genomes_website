Our main releases are contained in the [release directory](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/) on our ftp site.

These directories are dated for the [sequence index freeze](http://dev.1000genomes.org/faq/what-sequence-index-file) the analysis products are based on.

Our most current recent release is the phase 3 release in [20130502](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502). This represents an integrated set of SNPs, indels, MNPs, long insertions and deletions, copy number variations, and other types of structural variations discovered and genotyped in 2504 unrelated individuals.
