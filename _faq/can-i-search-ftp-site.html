<p>You can search the 1000 genomes ftp site.</p>
<p>There is a user interface to use for search at&nbsp;<a href="/ftpsearch" target="_blank">ftpsearch</a>. This allows you to specify the EBI or NCBI ftp site and to exclude particularly large groups of files like bams or fastq files.</p>
<p>This search is actually based on the&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/current.tree" target="_blank">current.tree</a>&nbsp;file. This file is an index of the ftp site. The relative path of all files and directories are listed aswell as their size, md5 checksum and last updated timestamp. It was originally designed to assist in the mirroring process for the two ftp sites but it contains useful information for all users of the ftp site.</p>
