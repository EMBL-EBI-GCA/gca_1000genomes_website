<p>Our current most recent release, the <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets/">Phase1 integrated data set</a>, contains fully phased haplotypes for 1092 individuals using both low coverage and exome data and has snps, indels and larger deletions. Please note the indels and larger deletions were modelled as point events so there may be some inconsistencies in the haplotypes which surround those events.</p>
