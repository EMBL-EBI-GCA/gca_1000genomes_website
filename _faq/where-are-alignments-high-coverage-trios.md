The alignment files which were used as part of the pilot project are found under [ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/data](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/data). These are all aligned to NCBI36.

There are also GRCh37 alignments available for the high coverage individuals from CEU and YRI ([ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/pilot2_high_cov_GRCh37_bams/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/pilot2_high_cov_GRCh37_bams/))

Please be aware much of the sequence data these alignments are based on is very short read data (36bp) and was generated a long time ago (~2008) so may not reflect current sequencing data.

A more modern data set for the CEU trio is available from Illumina on their [Platinum Genomes page](http://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes/)
