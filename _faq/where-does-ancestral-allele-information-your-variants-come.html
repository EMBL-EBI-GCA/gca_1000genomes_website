<p>The ancestral alleles associated with the phase1 release where generated using two different processes.</p>
<p>The snp ancestral alleles were derived from <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara/index.html">Ensembl Compara</a> <a href="http://aug2010.archive.ensembl.org/index.html">release 59</a>. The alignments used to generate them can be found in the <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/ancestral_alignments/">phase1/supporting directory</a>.</p>
<p>The indel ancestral alleles were generated using an separate process</p>
<p>The deletions should not have any ancestral alleles</p>
