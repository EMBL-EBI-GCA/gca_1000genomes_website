Reviewing the [list of data collections and their publications](/data-portal/data-collection) in our data portal is a good starting point.

We also share data via our FTP site and data may be available on our FTP site sometime beofre being added to the website. Data collection directories are available on the [FTP site](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/).

In addition, to track changes on our FTP site we provide change logs and a current.tree file, which list all files present on our [FTP site](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/) and any changes made to them.
