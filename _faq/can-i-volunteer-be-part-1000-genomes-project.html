<p>The 1000 genomes project is not accepting volunteers to be sequenced. More information about how samples were recruited please see <a href="/about">the About page</a>.</p>
<p>Another large scale resequencing project that does still have rounds of recruitment is the <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/">Personal Genomes Project</a></p>
