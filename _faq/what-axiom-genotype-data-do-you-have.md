There are two sets of Affymetrix genotypes available, one based on the [Axiom](http://www.affymetrix.com/browse/staticHtmlContentTemplate.jsp?staticHtmlMediaId=m1361217&isHtmlStatic=true&navMode=35810) platform and the other one on the [Affy 6](http://www.affymetrix.com/browse/products.jsp?productId=131533&navMode=34000&navAction=jump&aId=productsNav#1_1) chip. The axiom data was produced by Affymetrix themselves and available on 1261 Hapmap 3 individuals which overlap with 1000 genomes samples. This data set is part of our [phase1 analysis results](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/axiom_genotypes/). The affy 6 chip results are on our phsae3 individuals are available from [20131122_coriell_affy6](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20131122_coriell_affy6/)
