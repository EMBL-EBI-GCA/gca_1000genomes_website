The most complete set of Affymetrix genotypes are from our [phase 3 analysis](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/). There are genotypes for 3450 1000 Genomes samples from the Affy 6 chip available in [20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/) from the [Affy 6 chip](http://www.affymetrix.com/catalog/131533/AFFY/Genome-Wide+Human+SNP+Array+6.0#1_1)
