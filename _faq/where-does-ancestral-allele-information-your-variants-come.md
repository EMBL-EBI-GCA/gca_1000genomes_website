The ancestral alleles associated with the phase 1 release where generated using two different processes.

The SNP ancestral alleles were derived from [Ensembl Compara](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara/index.html) [release 59](http://aug2010.archive.ensembl.org/index.html). The alignments used to generate them can be found in the [phase1/supporting directory](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/ancestral_alignments/).

The indel ancestral alleles were generated using an separate process

The deletions should not have any ancestral alleles
