For the duration of the 1000 Genomes Project, a wiki was part of the project website. It was used for internal project discussions and membership was not provided to people outside the consortium.

Members of the 1000 Genomes Project consortium with quesries regarding access to the wiki should email [info@1000genomes.org](mailto:info@1000genomes.org).
