<p>Our sequence files are distributed in fastq format and can be found under the <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data/">data directory</a> of the ftp site, here there is a directory per individual which then contains all the sequence data we have for that individual aswell as all the alignment data we have</p>
<p>We also distribute meta data for all our sequencing runs in a <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence.index">sequence.index</a> file which is described in a <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README.sequence_data">README</a> on the ftp site</p>
