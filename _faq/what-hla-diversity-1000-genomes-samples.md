HLA diversity is not something which has been studied by the 1000 Genomes Project directly. 

Pierre-Antoine Gourraud, Jorge Oksenberg and colleages at UCSF carried out a HLA typing assay on [DNA sourced from Coriell](http://www.1000genomes.org/cell-lines-and-dna-coriell) for 1000 Genomes samples.

Their work assessing HLA Diversity is publised in [PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/)

[HLA diversity in the 1000 Genome Dataset](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097282)  
[PLoS One. 2014 Jul 2;9(7) ](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097282)

The HLA Types for the individuals assayed are available from the 1000 Genomes FTP site in [ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20140725_hla_genotypes/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20140725_hla_genotypes/)
