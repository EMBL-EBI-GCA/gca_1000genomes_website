HLA diversity is not something which was studied by the 1000 Genomes Project directly, however, groups have looked at the HLA diversity of the samples in the 1000 Genomes Project.

##2018 data

The most recent of these studies was published by [Laurent Abi-Rached, Julien Paganini and colleagues in 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206512) and covers 2,693 samples from the work of the 1000 Genomes Project. Details of the study and data used in this work are available via the publication and the HLA types are available on our FTP site at [ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HLA_types/](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/HLA_types/).

##2014 data

The FTP site also hosts data from an earlier study by Pierre-Antoine Gourraud, Jorge Oksenberg and colleages at UCSF who carried out an HLA typing assay on [DNA sourced from Coriell](/cell-lines-and-dna-coriell) for 1000 Genomes samples. This earlier study looks at only the 1,267 samples that were available at that time.

The earlier work assessing HLA Diversity is publised in ["HLA diversity in the 1000 Genome Dataset"](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097282), with data available from the 1000 Genomes FTP site in [ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20140725_hla_genotypes/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20140725_hla_genotypes/).
