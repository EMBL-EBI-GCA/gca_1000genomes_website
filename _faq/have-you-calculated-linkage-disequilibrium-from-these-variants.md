The 1000 Genomes Project's [phase three publication in 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393), which analysed data from the original 1000 Genomes Project on GRCh37, used linkage disequilibrium calculations to assess GWAS Type I error rates. This work is described in that publication and the accompanying supplementary material.

To look at Linkage Disequilibrium between variants that may be of interest to you, we recommend using Ensembl's [Linkage Disequilibrium Calculator](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/LD), which can be used with data from the 1000 Genomes Project or other studies.
