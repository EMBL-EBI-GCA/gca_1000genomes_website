The VCFs available from IGSR are all whole data collection VCFs, with genotypes of individuals included. We do not publish VCFs for just one population or for individuals. If you require a VCF for just one individual or population, we recommend using [VCF tools](https://vcftools.github.io/) to filter the data. To create a population VCF, you will need to know which individuals are part of each population, which can be obtained from our [Data portal](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/population).
