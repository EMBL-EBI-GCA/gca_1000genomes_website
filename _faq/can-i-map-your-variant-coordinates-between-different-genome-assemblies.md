We have data presented on GRCh38, GRCh37 and NCBI36, please check the data portal to see what assembly the data is on. If you need variant calls to be in a particular assembly it is best to go to dbSNP, Ensembl or an equivalent archive using their rs numbers as this will provide a definitive mapping.

If an rs number or equivalent is not available there are tools available to map between NCBI36, GRCh37 and GRCh38 from both [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/AssemblyConverter) and the [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap)
