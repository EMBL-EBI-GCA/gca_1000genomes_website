When studies are published, their variant call sets are submitted to the archives (dbSNP,DGVa, EVA, etc.).

The 1000 Genomes Project SNPs and short indels were all submitted to [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and longer structural variants to the [DGVa](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/).

The accessions for data sets in the archives can be found in the accompanying publications ([listed alongside the the data collections](/data-portal/data-collection)).
