<p>The pilot data for the 1000 genomes project was all mapped to NCBI36/hg18 build of the human assembly but once the data had been loaded into dbSNP it was mapped to GRCh37/hg19 and these are the coordinates that Ensembl and UCSC present to the world but this does mean that the coordinates from the pilot data on the 1000 genomes ftp site will be different to the coordinates presented in Ensembl and UCSC.</p>
