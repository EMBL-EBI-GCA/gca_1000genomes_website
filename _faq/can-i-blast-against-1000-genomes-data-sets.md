The 1000 genomes raw sequence data represents more then 30000x coverage of the human genome and there are no tools currently available to search against the complete data sets. You can use the [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/blastview) or [NCBI](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) blast services and then use these results to find the 1000 genomes variants already in dbSNP.
