Data from the 1000 Genomes Project has now been analysed multiple times and on different reference assemblies. In addition, further data sets have been generated and analysed. These studies, therefore, use different data, different reference assemblies and different methodologies, which can lead to different variant calls being made.

The studies that IGSR makes data available for are [listed with their accompanying publications](/data-portal/data-collection) in our data portal. The publications can provide further details.
