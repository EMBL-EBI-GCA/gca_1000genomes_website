The 1000 Genomes Project shares some samples with the HapMap project; any sample which starts with NA was likely part of the HapMap project. In the pilot stages of the project HapMap genotypes were also used to help quality control the data and identify sample swaps and contamination. Since phase 1 the HapMap data has not been used by the 1000 Genomes Project, and all genotypes were independantly identified by 1000 Genomes.
