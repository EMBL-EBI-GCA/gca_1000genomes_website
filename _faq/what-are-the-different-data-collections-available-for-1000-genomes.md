In IGSR, data is organised into collections that roughly correspond to studies or projects.

The samples collected by the 1000 Genomes Project have now been used in many different studies, some generating new data and others reanalysing existing data.

The final phase of the 1000 Genomes Project was phase 3 and represents 2504 samples on GRCh37.

The data from phase three of the 1000 Genomes Project was subsequently reanalysed on GRCh38.

Following this work, the samples have been resequenced to high-coverage, with additional related samples being sequenced, bringing the total number of samples up to 3,202. This data was analysed on GRCh38.

Further studies have also generated data on samples from the 1000 Genomes Project, including work by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC).

These [data collections are listed in our data portal](/data-portal/data-collection).
