<p>Our variant files are released via our <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/">release directory</a> in directories named for the sequence index freeze they are based on.</p>
<p>You may find information about the latest release in contained in&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/">20130502</a>&nbsp;and is described in&nbsp;<a href="/faq/where-most-recent-release">where is your most recent release?</a></p>
<p>A stable earlier release based on 1092 unrelated samples is Phase1 data release, it can be found under&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets/">phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets</a>. The phase1 data set contains information on all autosomes and chrX, Y and chrMT. The <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html">phase1 publication</a> is based on this data set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pilot release represents results obtained in the three pilot studies of the project (low coverage, high coverage trios and exome). The release data can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/paper_data_sets/a_map_of_human_variation">here</a>. &nbsp;The publication about the findings of pilot studies is in <a href="/sites/1000genomes.org/files/docs/nature09534.pdf">this pdf</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also find variant files in our <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/">technical/working</a> directory but please be aware these are experimental files which represent a work in progress and should always be treated with caution</p>
