<p>The 1000 genomes project has run two different pull down experiments. These are labelled as "exon targetted" and "exome".</p>
<p>An exon targetted run is part of the pilot study which targetted 1000 genes in nearly 700 individuals. The targets for this pilot can be found in the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/technical/reference/" target="_blank">pilot_data/technical/reference</a> directory.</p>
<p>An exome run is part of the whole exome sequencing project which is targetting the entirety of the CCDS gene set. The targets used for the phase1 data release of 1092 samples can be found in &nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets_phases1_and_2/" target="_blank">technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets_phases1_and_2</a>;&nbsp;the targets for phase3 analysis can be found in <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets/" target="_blank">technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets/</a></p>
