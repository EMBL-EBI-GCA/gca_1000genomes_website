<p>The 1000 Genomes FTP site is available as an end point in the <a href="https://www.globus.org/">Globus Online system</a>. In order to access the data you need to sign up for an account with Globus via their <a href="https://www.globus.org/SignUp">signup page</a>. You must also install the <a href="https://support.globus.org/entries/24044351">Globus Connect Personal software</a>&nbsp;and setup a personal endpoint to download the data too.</p>
<p>The 1000 Genomes end point is one of several EMBL-EBI hosted end points and is called ebi#1000genomes</p>
<p>When you have setup your personal end point you should be able to start a transfer using their web front end.</p>
