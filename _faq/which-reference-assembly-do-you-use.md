The reference assembly the 1000 Genomes Project has mapped sequence data to has changed over the course of the project.

For the pilot phase we mapped data to NCBI36. A copy of our reference fasta file can be found on the [ftp site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/technical/reference/).

For the phase 1 and phase 3 analysis we mapped to GRCh37. Our fasta file which can be found [here](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/) called human_g1k_v37.fasta.gz, it contains the autosomes, X, Y and MT but no haplotype sequence or EBV.

We are currently in the process of remapping the final phase 3 data onto GRCh38.
