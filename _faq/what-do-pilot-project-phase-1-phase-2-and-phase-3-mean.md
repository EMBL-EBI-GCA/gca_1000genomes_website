The 1000 genomes full project has been divided into phases to represent the dispersed nature of the sample collection.

The initial phase of the project was called the pilot project. This was split into 3 pilot studies, low coverage pilot (pilot1), high coverage pilot (pilot2) and the exon targetted pilot (pilot3). This data was completely in 2009, [published in Nature in 2010](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09534.html) and all the data associated with it is available in the [pilot_data](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/) directory on the ftp site.

Phase 1 represents low coverage and exome data analysis available for the first 1092 samples. The phase 1 low coverage alignment data freeze is represented by the 20101123 [sequence index](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/){:target="_blank"} and [alignment index](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices/20101123.alignment.index){:target="_blank"} . The phase 1 exome alignment data freeze is represented by the 20110521 [sequence index](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/){:target="_blank"} and [exome alignment index](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices/20110521.exome.alignment.index){:target="_blank"}. The alignment data associated with the phase 1 project can be found in the [phase 1](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/){:target="_blank"} directory. The [phase1 analysis has now been published](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html){:target="_blank"} as is freely distributable under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence.

The analysis results associated with the paper can be found in the [phase1/analysis_results directory](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/)

Phase 2 represents an expanded set of samples, around 1700 in number. The sequence data has been finalised and is represented in the [20111114 sequence index.](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20111114.sequence.index) This data is being used for method development to both improve on existing methods from phase 1 and also develop new methods to handle features like multi allelic variant sites and true intergration of complex variation and structural variants.

Phase 3 represents 2500 samples including new African samples and samples from South Asia. The new methods developed in phase 2 will be applied to this data set an a final catalogue of variation will be released on the ftp site. It is planned in phase3 to only use Illumina platform data with 70bp reads or longer.
