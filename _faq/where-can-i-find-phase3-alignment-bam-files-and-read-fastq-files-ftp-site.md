In preparation for publication of the phase3 manuscript, we have moved all phase3 BAM files and fastq files from

[ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data)

to

[ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data)

The directory structure does not change under data/

Please note that the phase3 variant call VCF files under ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502 stay where they are.
