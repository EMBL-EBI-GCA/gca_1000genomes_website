Details of alignment methodology differ between data sets and the types of sequence data being aligned. 

Full details of methodology can be found in the [publications accompanying the data collections](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection) and, for unpublished alignments, in the README files placed with the data collections on our FTP site.
