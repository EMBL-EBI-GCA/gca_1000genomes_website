**Where are the sequence files located?**

Our sequence files are distributed in fastq format and can be found under the [data directory](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/) of the ftp site, here there is a directory per individual which then contains all the sequence data we have for that individual aswell as all the alignment data we have.

We also distribute meta data for all our sequencing runs in a [sequence.index](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence.index) file which is described in a [README](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README.sequence_data) on the ftp site.


**Where can I find phase3 alignment BAM files and read fastq files on the ftp site?**

You can find all the 1000 Genomes phase 3 BAM and fastq files in:

[ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data)

All BAM files from IGSR can be found in:

[ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections)
