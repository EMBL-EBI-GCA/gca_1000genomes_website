The 1000 Genomes Project SNPs and short indels get submitted to [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and longer structural variants get submitted to the [DGVa](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/).

Where possible, release VCF files contain the appropriate IDs in the ID column, such as dbSNP rs IDs.

The archives contain variants discovered by the final phase of the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3) and also by the preliminary pilot and phase 1 stages of the project. As methods were developed during the project, phase 3 represents the final data set.
