Both the Sanger Institute and the Broad institute have carried on genotyping of 1000 genomes and Hapmap samples on the [Omni Platform](http://www.illumina.com/dna/omni/index.asp?utm_medium=banners&amp;utm_campaign=omni). The most recent set of omni genotypes can be found in the phase3 release directory [release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/) These contain GRCh37 based vcf files for the chip and normalised and raw intensity files.

The [ShapeIt2](http://www.shapeit.fr/) scaffolds for this data, which were used in the phase 3 haplotype refinement project can also be found in the phase3 supporting directory [release/20130502/supporting/shapeit2_scaffolds/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/shapeit2_scaffolds/)
