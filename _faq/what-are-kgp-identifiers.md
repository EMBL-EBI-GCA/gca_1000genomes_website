kgp identifiers were not created by the 1000 Genomes Project. We also do not maintain them. They were created by Illumina for their genotyping platform before some variants identified during the pilot phase of the project had been assigned rs numbers.

We do not possess a mapping of these identifiers to current rs numbers. As far as we are aware no such list exists.
