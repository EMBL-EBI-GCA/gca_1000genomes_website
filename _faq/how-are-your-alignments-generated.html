<p>The 1000 genomes project has used several different alignment algorithms during its duration. For the pilot project we used <a href="http://maq.sourceforge.net/">MAQ</a> for Illumina, Corona lite for SOLiD and <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/ssaha2/">ssaha</a> for 454. For the main project we use <a href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/">BWA</a> for Illumina and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/bfast/index.php?title=Main_Page">BFAST</a> for SOLiD, 454 started with ssaha but the final set of 454 alignments used <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/">smalt</a>. The full process is described in the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README.alignment_data">README</a></p>
