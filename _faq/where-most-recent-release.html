<p>Our main releases are contained in the <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/">release directory</a> on our ftp site.</p>
<p>These directories are dated for the <a href="http://dev.1000genomes.org/faq/what-sequence-index-file">sequence index freeze</a> the analysis products are based on.</p>
<p>Our most current recent release is the phase3 release in&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502">20130502</a>. This represents an integrated set of SNPs, indels, MNPs, long insertions and deletions, copy number variations, and other types of structural variations discovered and genotyped in 2504 unrelated individuals. Currently only results on autosomes are available; results for chromosomes X, Y and MT will become available around November 2014. &nbsp;</p>
