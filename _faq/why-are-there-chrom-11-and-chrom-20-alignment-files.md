The chrom 11 and chrom 20 alignment files are put in place to give the 1000 genomes analysis group a small section of the genome to run test analyses on before committing to a particular strategy to run across the whole genome.
Everything in the 11 and 20 files is also represented in the mapped bam file.
To get a complete view of what data we aligned you only need to download the mapped and unmapped bams, the chrom11 and 20 bams are there as a convenience to the analysis group.
