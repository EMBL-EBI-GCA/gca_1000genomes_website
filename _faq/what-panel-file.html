<p>All our variant call releases since <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20100804/">20100804</a> have come with a panel file. This file lists all the individuals who are part of the release and the population they come from.</p>
<p>This is a tab delimited file which must in its first two columns have sample and population, some files may then have subsequent columns which describe additional info like which super population a sample comes from or what sequencing platforms have been used to generate sequence data for that sample.</p>
<p>The panel files have names like&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets/integrated_call_samples.20101123.ALL.panel">integrated_call_samples.20101123.ALL.panel</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/integrated_call_samples_v2.20130502.ALL.panel">integrated_call_samples_v2.20130502.ALL.panel</a></p>
<p>These panel files can be used by <a href="http://browser.1000genomes.org/tools.html">our browser tools</a>, the data slicer, variant pattern finder and vcf to ped converter to establish population groups for filtering</p>
