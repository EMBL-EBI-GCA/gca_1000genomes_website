Information relating to ancestral alleles is available for phase three of the 1000 Genomes Project. The work on annotating ancestral alleles is described in Section 8.3 of the supplementary material of the [publication](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15393.html) accompanying that work.
