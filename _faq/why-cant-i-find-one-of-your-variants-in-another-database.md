As is described in ["Why are the coordinates of some variants different to what is displayed in other databases?"](/faq/why-are-the-coordinates-of-some-variants-different-to-what-is-displayed-in-other-databases/), different analyses may produce different results.

The [publications](/data-portal/data-collection) accompanying the data collections list the accessions for the variant calls in the variation archives.
