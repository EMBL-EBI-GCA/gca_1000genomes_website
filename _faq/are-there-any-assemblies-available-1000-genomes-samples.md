Efforts to create de novo assemblies are under way within the project but no data is available for release. The Gerstein Lab at Yale University have created a diploid version of the NA12878 sequence. This is available from the [Gerstein website](http://sv.gersteinlab.org/) under [NA12878_diploid](http://sv.gersteinlab.org/NA12878_diploid/). When used groups should cite [AlleleSeq: analysis of allele-specific expression and binding in a network framework, Rozowsky et al, Molecular Systems Biology 7:522](http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v7/n1/full/msb201154.html)
