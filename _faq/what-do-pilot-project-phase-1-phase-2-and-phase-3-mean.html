<p>The 1000 genomes full project has been divided into phases to represent the dispersed nature of the sample collection.</p>
<p>The initial phase of the project was called the pilot project. This was split into 3 pilot studies, low coverage pilot (pilot1), high coverage pilot (pilot2) and the exon targetted pilot (pilot3). This data was completely in 2009, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09534.html">published in Nature in 2010</a> and all the data associated with it is available in the <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/">pilot_data</a> directory on the ftp site.</p>
<p>Phase 1 represents low coverage and exome data analysis available for the first 1092 samples. The phase 1 low coverage alignment data freeze is represented by the 20101123 <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/" target="_blank">sequence index</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices/20101123.alignment.index">alignment index</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;The phase 1 exome alignment data freeze is represented by the 20110521 <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/" target="_blank">sequence index</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices/20110521.exome.alignment.index">exome alignment index</a>. The alignment data associated with the phase 1 project can be found in the <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/">phase 1</a> directory. The <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html">phase1 analysis has now been published</a>&nbsp;as is freely distributable&nbsp;<span>under a&nbsp;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence. &nbsp;Please share our paper appropriately.

<p>Phase 2 represents an expanded set of samples, around 1700 in number. The sequence data has been finalised and is represented in the <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20111114.sequence.index">20111114 sequence index.</a> This data is being used for method development to both improve on existing methods from phase 1 and also develop new methods to handle features like multi allelic variant sites and true intergration of complex variation and structural variants.</p>
<p>Phase 3 represents 2500 samples including new African samples and samples from South Asia. The new methods developed in phase 2 will be applied to this data set an a final catalogue of variation will be released on the ftp site. It is planned in phase3 to only use Illumina platform data with 70bp reads or longer.</p>
