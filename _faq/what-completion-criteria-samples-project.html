<p>The project aims to sequence 2500 individuals in total both low coverage whole genome sequencing and <span>exome</span> sequencing. So far more than 1000 samples have been sequenced.</p>
<p>Our completion criteria for our two sequencing stratergies are:</p>
<p>All low coverage samples must have 3x non duplicated aligned coverage (assuming genome size of 2.75GB)<br />
All exome samples must have 70% of their targets covered to at least 20x. The target list can be found in&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets_phases1_and_2/">technical/reference/exome_pull_down_targets_phases1_and_2</a></p>
