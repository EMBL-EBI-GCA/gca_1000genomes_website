The exon targetted run is part of the pilot study which targetted 1000 genes in nearly 700 individuals using a custom array. The targets for this pilot can be found in the [pilot_data/technical/reference](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/technical/reference/){:target="_blank"} directory.
