Our variant files are released via our [release directory](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/) in directories named for the sequence index freeze they are based on.

You may find information about the latest release in contained in [20130502](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/) and is described in [where is your most recent release?](http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/where-most-recent-release)

A stable earlier release based on 1092 unrelated samples is Phase1 data release, it can be found under [phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets/). The phase1 data set contains information on all autosomes and chrX, Y and chrMT. The [phase1 publication](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html) is based on this data set. 

The pilot release represents results obtained in the three pilot studies of the project (low coverage, high coverage trios and exome). The release data can be found at [here](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/paper_data_sets/a_map_of_human_variation).  The publication about the findings of pilot studies is in [this pdf](http://www.1000genomes.org/sites/1000genomes.org/files/docs/nature09534.pdf). 

You may also find variant files in our [technical/working](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/) directory but please be aware these are experimental files which represent a work in progress and should always be treated with caution
