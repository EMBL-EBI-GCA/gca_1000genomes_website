The 1000 Genomes pilot project SNPs have all been accessioned by [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and are available in dbSNP 132 onward. In addition, SNPs from the later phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project and the final phase 3 have also been added to dbSNP. The sets of SNPs identified by these stages are not identical to each other. Data from phase 3 represents the final set of SNPs identified by the project, with the earlier phase 1 and pilot sets representing preliminary results while methods continued to be developed by the project.
