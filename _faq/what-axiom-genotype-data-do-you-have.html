<p>There are two sets of Affymetrix genotypes available, one based on the <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/browse/staticHtmlContentTemplate.jsp?staticHtmlMediaId=m1361217&amp;isHtmlStatic=true&amp;navMode=35810">Axiom</a> platform and the other one on the <a href="http://www.affymetrix.com/browse/products.jsp?productId=131533&amp;navMode=34000&amp;navAction=jump&amp;aId=productsNav#1_1">Affy 6</a> chip. The axiom data was produced by Affymetrix themselves and available on 1261 Hapmap 3 individuals which overlap with 1000 genomes samples. This data set is part of our <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/axiom_genotypes/">phase1 analysis results</a>. The affy 6 chip results are on our phsae3 individuals are available from <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20131122_coriell_affy6/">20131122_coriell_affy6</a></p>
