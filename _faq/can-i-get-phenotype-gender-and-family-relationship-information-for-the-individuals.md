For the 1000 Genomes Project, due to the freely available nature of the data, no phenotype information was collected for any of the samples. All donors were over 18 and declared themselves to be healthy at the time of collection. We do provide a [sample spreadsheet](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_sample_info.xlsx) and a [pedigree file](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_g1k.ped) which contain ethnicity and gender for 1000 Genomes samples.
