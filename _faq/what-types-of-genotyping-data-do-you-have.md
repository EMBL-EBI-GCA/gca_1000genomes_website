The 1000 genomes project has multiple sets of high density genotype information on both Illumina and Affymetrix Platforms.

## Affy 6.0 genotype

[Coriel](http://ccr.coriell.org/Default.aspx?public=true) has carried out Affy 6.0 genotyping on many of the samples which are part of the [NHGRI Cell line catalog.](http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/NHGRI/?SsId=11)

These files are available on our FTP site in [release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/)

## Axiom genotype

The Affymetrix Axiom Exome chip was used to genotype some samples for the [phase 1 analysis](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1). There are genotypes for 1248 1000 Genomes samples from the Affy 6 chip available in [phase1/analysis_results/supporting/axiom_genotypes](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/supporting/axiom_genotypes/) from the [Axiom Exome Chip](http://www.affymetrix.com/estore/browse/products.jsp?productId=prod570018#1_1)

## Omni genotype

Both the Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute have carried on genotyping of 1000 Genomes and HapMap samples on the [Omni Platform](http://www.illumina.com/dna/omni/index.asp?utm_medium=banners&amp;utm_campaign=omni). The most recent set of Omni genotypes can be found in the phase 3 release directory [release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/hd_genotype_chip/) These contain GRCh37 based vcf files for the chip, and normalised and raw intensity files.

The [ShapeIt2](http://www.shapeit.fr/) scaffolds for these data, which were used in the phase 3 haplotype refinement project, can also be found in the phase 3 supporting directory [release/20130502/supporting/shapeit2_scaffolds/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/shapeit2_scaffolds/).
