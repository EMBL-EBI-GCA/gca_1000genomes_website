**How many individuals were sequenced?**

The 1000 Genomes Project aims to sequenced 2504 individuals in total both low coverage whole genome sequencing and exome sequencing. Further samples added into the IGSR will increase this number.

**Which samples are you sequencing?**

There is a list of samples who are part of the project available from [this spreadsheet](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_sample_info.xlsx){:target="_blank"}. There is also a pedigree file available from [ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_g1k.ped](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_g1k.ped)

Please note this spreadsheet does list samples who are related to the ones we are sequencing but aren't themselves being sequenced. If a sample has no data in the Total LC or Total E Sequence columns it means it was not sequenced for the main project
