IGSR includes samples grouped into populations from a number of sampling projects, with most samples coming from the 1000 Genomes Project, the Human Genome Diversity Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project.

For the 1000 Genomes Project populations, the population criteria are listed with the populations on the [Coriell website](https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Collections). For other data collections, please check the [associated publications](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection).

Further detail can also be found in the supplementary material of the 1000 Genomes Project phase three publication.
