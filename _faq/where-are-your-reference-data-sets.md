Our reference data sets can be found in [technical/reference/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/) and this includes items like the reference genome, ancestral alignments and standard annotation sets.

There is also a frozen version of the reference data used for the pilot project available in [pilot_data/technical/reference](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/technical/reference/)
