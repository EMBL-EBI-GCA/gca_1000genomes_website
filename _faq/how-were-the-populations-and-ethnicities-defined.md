Membership of ethnic groups was self-defined; the individuals whose genomes were sampled agreed that they matched the criteria for that ethnic group. The criteria for inclusion in the ethnic groups varied, with some requiring all four grand-parents to be members of that group or from a specific geographic area, while others were less specific, depending on the diversity and admixture of the area/ethnicity.

For 1000 Genomes populations, the ethnicity criteria are listed with the populations on the [Coriell website](https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Collections).
