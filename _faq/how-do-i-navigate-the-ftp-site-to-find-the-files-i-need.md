The easiest way to find the files you're looking for is with the [Data Portal](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample). You can search for individuals, populations and data collections, and filter the files by data type and technologies. This will give you locations of the files, which you can use to download directly, or to export a list to use with a download manager.
