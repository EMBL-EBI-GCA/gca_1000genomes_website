<p>These codes represent our populations, each three letter code represents a different population, CEU means Northern Europeans from Utah and TSI means Tuscans from Italy. There is a summary of all these codes both in a <a href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README.populations">readme</a> on the ftp site and in the alternative question&nbsp;<a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/which-populations-are-part-your-study">Which populations are part of your study?</a></p>
