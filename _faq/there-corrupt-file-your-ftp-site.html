<p>As many of our files are very large &gt;5GB they can become corrupt during download.</p>
<p>Before emailing us to let us know about a problem file the first thing you need to check is the md5 checksum of your file to see if it matches our records in the <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/data#DataAccess">current.tree</a> file.</p>
<p>If the size and or the md5 checksum don't match then you need to attempt to download the file again.</p>
<p>If the size of the file and the md5 check sum matches what is in the current.tree then please email <a href="mailto:info@1000genomes.org">info@1000genomes.org</a> to let us know which file has a problem.</p>
