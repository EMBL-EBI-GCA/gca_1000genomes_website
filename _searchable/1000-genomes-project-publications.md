#The 1000 Genomes Project Publications

The main publications from the 1000 Genomes Project are the final publications from phase 3 of the project.

- [1000 genomes structural variation paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15394.html)

Phase 2 of the project, which focused on technical development, did not lead directly to a Consortium publication. The Consortium did, however, produce summary publications from the other sequencing phases of the project, which were phase 1 on the main project and the pilot project.
