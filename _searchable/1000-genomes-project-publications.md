#The 1000 Genomes Project Publications

The main publications from the 1000 Genomes Project are the final publications from phase 3 of the project, which were publisheed in *Nature* in October 2015.

- ["A global reference for human genetic variation" *Nature* 2015](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15393.html)

- ["An integrated map of structural variation in 2,504 human genomes" *Nature* 2015](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/full/nature15394.html)

Phase 2 of the project, which focused on technical development, did not lead directly to a Consortium publication. The Consortium did, however, produce summary publications from the other sequencing phases of the project, which were phase 1 on the main project and the pilot project.

- ["An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes" *Nature* 2012](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422/full/nature11632.html)

- ["A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing" *Nature* 2010](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09534.html)

A full list of Consortium publications is available from [Europe PMC](http://europepmc.org/search?page=1&query=AUTH:%221000+Genomes+Project+Consortium%22&restrict=All+results).
