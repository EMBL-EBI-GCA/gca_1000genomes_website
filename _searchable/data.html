#IGSR and 1000 Genomes data browser

IGSR incorporates data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project along with other openly available data on the same and other samples. To enable exploration of the available data, IGSR is developing a data browser, which we hope to make available here in 2016.

# 1000 Genomes Data and Sample Information

The 1000 Genomes Project is a community resource project that aims to release data rapidly for the benefit of the scientific community.

# Data released by the 1000 Genomes Project

## Sample lists and sequencing progress

A summary of sequencing done for each of the three pilot projects is available [here](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/docs/PilotsSummary.pdf). The list of samples and allocations is provided in a [spreadsheet](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/wo
rking/20130606_sample_info/20130606_sample_info.xlsx).

## Variant Calls

Our variant calls are always released in [vcf format](/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41). The released can be found in the release directory [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release).

## Alignments

The main project alignments are available in [BAM](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) format. A list of the files currently available can be found in the alignment index [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment.index)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/alignment.index). Alignment statistics can be found in the alignment_indices directory [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/alignment_indices). There is also a [README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/historical_data/former_toplevel/README.alignment_data.md) which explains the alignment process and file layout

## Raw sequence files

The main project raw sequence data is available in fastq format. A list of files currently available can be found in the sequence.index [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence.index)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/sequence.index) Sequence statistics can be found in the sequence_indices directory [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/sequence_indices). There is also a [README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/historical_data/former_toplevel/README.sequence_data) which explains the sequence processing and the file layout

# How to Access 1000 Genomes Data

## Download data

The data for this project can be downloaded from the 1000 Genomes FTP site hosted at the EBI [ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/)

The data can be downloaded via FTP, aspera and globus gridftp. More information about using aspera or globus can be found in our FAQ

[How to download files using aspera](http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/how-download-files-using-aspera)  
[How to download files using globus](http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/can-i-access-1000-genomes-data-globus-online)

The NCBI and the Amazon S3 bucket still hosts 1000 Genomes data but no longer mirrors new data posted by the ongoing project. Both these locations reflect the structure of the FTP site in August 2015 and hold all the pilot, phase1 and phase3 data.

NCBI FTP Site : [ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp)  
Amazon S3 : [s3://1000genomes](denied:s3://1000genomes)

FTP Hierarchy

The FTP structure was changed in September 2015\. The new structure is described in the [FTP site structure README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README_ftp_site_structure.md) 

## Browse data

The first set of SNP calls representing the [July 2010](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/release/2010_07/) data release can be viewed directly through the 1000 Genomes browser at [http://browser.1000genomes.org](http://browser.1000genomes.org "http://browser.1000genomes.org"). Launch the browser and [view a sample region here.](http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/Location/View?r=6:133017695-133161157)

**For more information about using the 1000 Genomes browser, download the [Quick start guide](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/1000genomes_browser_quickstart.pdf)**

## Amazon Web Services

The alignment files for the 1000 Genomes Pilot Porject are available as a [public data set](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/) via Amazon Web Services (AWS). Further information can be found on 1000 Genomes [public data set page](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/4383) or directly on [http://s3.amazonaws.com/1000genomes](http://s3.amazonaws.com/1000genomes).

# Data release policy

As a community resource project, the 1000 Genomes Project publicly releases data on a regular basis. The sequencing centers release the raw reads to the SRA. The Data Processing Group, Analysis Group, and DCC release alignments, re-calibrated error rates, and SNP calls on individual samples. Data that passed quality filters are the most visible, but data that did not pass quality filters are also available. When the Structural Variation Group has developed its methods, the structural variant calls on individual samples will be released. Eventually the Project will release haplotypes and imputed variant calls. Data formats and analysis software developed by the Project are also made publicly available.

# Sample Availability

All the samples studied by the 1000 Genomes Project are or will be available as DNA and cell lines to scientific investigators for research projects. Many of the samples are currently available from the non-profit [Coriell Institute for Medical Research](http://ccr.coriell.org/sections/Collections/NHGRI/hapmap.aspx?PgId=266&coll=GM). Cell lines and DNA from additional populations will become available through 2011.

# Use of the Project data, presentations and publications, and authorship
{: #DataUse}

The data producers release the Project data quickly, prior to publication, in the expectation that they will be valuable for many researchers. In keeping with [Fort Lauderdale principles](http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/WellcomeReport0303.pdf), data users may use the data for many studies, but are expected to allow the data producers to make the first presentations and to publish the first paper with global analyses of the data.
