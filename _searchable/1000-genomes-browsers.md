#Genome Browsers

##Ensembl

Data from the 1000 Genomes Project can be viewed in Ensembl. The current release of Ensembl, which uses GRCh38, can be found on [http://www.ensembl.org](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index).

During the 1000 Genomes project, GRCh37 was used as the reference genome. Ensembl mantains an GRCh37 version of their browser on [http://grch37.ensembl.org](http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index).

##1000 Genomes Browsers

While the 1000 Genomes Project was active, it maintained a project specific version of the [Ensembl Browser](http://www.ensembl.org), based on GRCh37, to visualise its variants. This browser can be found at [http://browser.1000g enomes.org.](http://browser.1000genomes.org)

###Phase 3

The [main browser](http://browser.1000g enomes.org) currently displays the SNPs and indels from the [Phase 3 Release](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/). This runs Ensembl version 80.

###Phase 1

The phase 1 browser is still available at [http://phase1browser.1000genomes.org/index.html](http://phase1browser.1000genomes.org/index.html). This runs Ensembl version 73.

###Pilot

There is also a version of the browser which holds the pilot data from ["A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing", Nature 467, 1061-1073](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09534.html) at [http://pilotbrowser.1000genomes.org](http://pilotbrowser.1000genomes.org/index.html). This uses Ensembl version 60 and is based on NCBI36 coordinates.

###Tutorials and guides

You can find instructions for how to use our browser [in .doc format](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/browser/1000genomes_browser_main_project_20110521/The_1000_Genomes_Browser_Tutorial.ensembl_65.doc). There is also a [tutorial](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/1000_genomes_browser_pilot_20110506.doc) for the pilot browser and a [Quickstart Guide](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/1000genomes_browser_quickstart.pdf).

You can also access the databases which sit behind our browser, for more details about this please look at [the Public MySQL Instance](/node/517) page.

There are also more tips for Ensembl both on the [main ensembl site](http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/index.html) and their [blog](http://www.ensembl.info/).

The [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) also provide a [1000 genomes browser](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/tools/1000genomes/) hosted on their site.
