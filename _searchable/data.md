#IGSR and 1000 Genomes data browser

IGSR incorporates data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project along with other openly available data on the same and other samples. To enable exploration of the available data, IGSR is developing a data browser, which we hope to make available here in 2016.

![HipSci screen shot](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/images/hipsci_screen.png?raw=true)

A browser similar to the one we hope to provide can be seen by visiting the [HipSci project](http://www.hipsci.org/lines/#/lines).

#Accessing and using data

##Using data from IGSR

If you want to use data from IGSR for any purpose, you should read the information relating to [data reuse](/IGSR_disclaimer) and check what policy or policies apply to the data you wish to use.

##Types of available data

###Data released by the 1000 Genomes Project

#### Sample lists and sequencing progress

A summary of sequencing done for each of the three pilot projects is available [here](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/docs/PilotsSummary.pdf). 

The list of samples and allocations is provided in a [spreadsheet](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/wo
rking/20130606_sample_info/20130606_sample_info.xlsx).

#### Variant Calls

Our variant calls are always released in [VCF format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/). The released calls from the final phase of the project can be found in the release directory for 2nd May 2013 on the [EBI FTP site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502).

#### Alignments

The main project alignments are available in the [BAM and CRAM](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/) formats. A list of the files currently available can be found in the alignment index [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment.index)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/alignment.index). Alignment statistics can be found in the alignment_indices directory [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/alignment_indices). There is also a [README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/historical_data/former_toplevel/README.alignment_data.md) which explains the alignment process and file layout

#### Raw sequence files

The main project raw sequence data is available in fastq format. A list of files currently available can be found in the sequence.index [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence.index)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/sequence.index) Sequence statistics can be found in the sequence_indices directory [EBI](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices)\|[NCBI](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/sequence_indices). There is also a [README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/historical_data/former_toplevel/README.sequence_data) which explains the sequence processing and the file layout




# Sample Availability

All the samples studied by the 1000 Genomes Project are or will be available as DNA and cell lines to scientific investigators for research projects. Many of the samples are currently available from the non-profit [Coriell Institute for Medical Research](http://ccr.coriell.org/sections/Collections/NHGRI/hapmap.aspx?PgId=266&coll=GM). Cell lines and DNA from additional populations will become available through 2011.

The 1000 Genomes Project is a community resource project that aims to release data rapidly for the benefit of the scientific community.

# How to Access 1000 Genomes Data

## Download data

The data for this project can be downloaded from the 1000 Genomes FTP site hosted at the EBI [ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/)

The data can be downloaded via FTP, aspera and globus gridftp. More information about using aspera or globus can be found in our FAQ

[How to download files using aspera](http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/how-download-files-using-aspera)  
[How to download files using globus](http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/can-i-access-1000-genomes-data-globus-online)

The NCBI and the Amazon S3 bucket still hosts 1000 Genomes data but no longer mirrors new data posted by the ongoing project. Both these locations reflect the structure of the FTP site in August 2015 and hold all the pilot, phase1 and phase3 data.

NCBI FTP Site : [ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp)  
Amazon S3 : [s3://1000genomes](denied:s3://1000genomes)

FTP Hierarchy

The FTP structure was changed in September 2015\. The new structure is described in the [FTP site structure README](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README_ftp_site_structure.md) 

## Browse data

The first set of SNP calls representing the [July 2010](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/release/2010_07/) data release can be viewed directly through the 1000 Genomes browser at [http://browser.1000genomes.org](http://browser.1000genomes.org "http://browser.1000genomes.org"). Launch the browser and [view a sample region here.](http://browser.1000genomes.org/Homo_sapiens/Location/View?r=6:133017695-133161157)

**For more information about using the 1000 Genomes browser, download the [Quick start guide](/sites/1000genomes.org/files/documents/1000genomes_browser_quickstart.pdf)**

## Amazon Web Services

The alignment files for the 1000 Genomes Pilot Porject are available as a [public data set](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/) via Amazon Web Services (AWS). Further information can be found on 1000 Genomes [public data set page](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/4383) or directly on [http://s3.amazonaws.com/1000genomes](http://s3.amazonaws.com/1000genomes).
