# The 1000 Genomes Project is holding a tutorial at [ASHG 2012](http://www.ashg.org/2012meeting/)

The tutorial being held at the [San Francisco Marriot Marquis](http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/sfodt-san-francisco-marriott-marquis/) from 7pm to 9:00pm on Wednesday 7th November

The 1000 Genomes Project has released the sequence data and an integrated set of variants, genotypes, and haplotypes for the 1092 samples in the phase 1 set, and the sequence data for the phase 2 set. This tutorial describes the data sets, how to access them, and how to use them.

The topics being covered are

1\.  (15 min talk, 3 min questions)  Description of the 1000 Genomes data – Mark DePristo [[slides](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20121109_ashg_2012_tutorial/ASHG_1000genomes_overview_MDePristo_20121107.pdf)]  
2\.  (15 min talk, 3 min questions)  How to access the data – Laura Clarke [[slides](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20121109_ashg_2012_tutorial/ASHG_how_to_access_1000genomes_data_LClarke_20121107.pdf)]
