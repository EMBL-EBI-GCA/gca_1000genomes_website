#The Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium

The Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSV) creates a high-quality maps of human structural variation and develops new methods, taking advantage of the burgeoning array of genomics assays now available to define genomic structure.

The International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) is working with the HGSV to assist with data coordination, analysis and distribution. The data collected by the HGSV group so far can be found on our [FTP site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/) and can be browsed through our [data portal](/data-portal/data-collection/structural-variation).

The HGSV is following on work performed previously by the 1000 Genomes Project Structural Variation Analysis Group. It is also hosted with the data on [the FTP site](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/README_hgsvc_datareuse_statement.md).

Details of the different phases of the HGSVC are available in the data portal:
* [HGSVC](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/structural-variation)
* [HGSVC2](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/hgsvc2) 
* [HGSVC3](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/hgsvc3)

Please use the [data reuse policy for each phase](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp//data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/README_hgsvc_datareuse_statement.md).

If you have any questions about this project please email [contact@hgsvc.org](malito:contact@hgsvc.org).
